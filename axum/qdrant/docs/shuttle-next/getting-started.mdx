Simple 'Hello world' app using Shuttle Next.

```bash
cargo new --lib hello-world
cd hello-world
```

Make sure that your `Cargo.toml` file looks like the one below -- having the right dependencies is key!
You'll also notice that this is a `cdylib` and not a binary, like other Shuttle projects.

```toml Cargo.toml
[package]
name = "hello-world"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[lib]
crate-type = [ "cdylib" ]

[dependencies]
shuttle-next = "0.18.0"
```

Using the `shuttle-next::app!` macro, we can create HTTP API endpoints, setting the
method and the route endpoint in the `shuttle::endpoint()` macro arguments. Any function
that is a valid `axum` handler can be used, and you are free to add functions that aren't
annotated with the `shuttle_next::endpoint` macro and use them in your handlers. For now,
everything has to go in the same file, inside the `shuttle_next::app!` macro.

```Rust lib.rs
shuttle_next::app! {
    #[shuttle_next::endpoint(method = get, route = "/hello")]
    async fn hello() -> &'static str {
        "Hello, World!"
    }
}
```

To test your app locally you'll first need to add the `wasm32-wasi` target:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-wasi
```

And we're ready to start it up:

```bash
cargo shuttle run
```

Next, curl it to verify that it's working:

```bash
curl localhost:8000/hello
```

We can also add an endpoint that takes the body from the request using the axum `BodyStream`
extractor, lazily map its bytes to uppercase and stream it back in our response:

First, lets add the `futures` crate to our `Cargo.toml`:
```
cargo add futures
```

```rust lib.rs
shuttle_next::app! {
    // We need to add some imports (inside the app! macro), 
    // all re-exported from axum 0.6
    use shuttle_next::body::StreamBody;
    use shuttle_next::extract::BodyStream;
    use shuttle_next::response::{Response, IntoResponse};
    
    // We'll also need the futures `TryStreamExt` trait to manipulate 
    // the body stream
    use futures::TryStreamExt;

    #[shuttle_next::endpoint(method = post, route = "/uppercase")]
    async fn uppercase(body: BodyStream) -> impl IntoResponse {
        let chunk_stream = body.map_ok(|chunk| {
            chunk
                .iter()
                .map(|byte| byte.to_ascii_uppercase())
                .collect::<Vec<u8>>()
        });
        Response::new(StreamBody::new(chunk_stream))
    }
}
```

Let's run it again, and add a body to our request:
```bash
curl localhost:8000/uppercase -d "Please convert me to uppercase."
```

We can also add more handlers with the same route, granted they have different
HTTP methods:

```Rust lib.rs
shuttle_next::app! {
    #[shuttle_next::endpoint(method = get, route = "/hello")]
    async fn get_hello() -> &'static str {
        "Hello from get_hello!"
    }

	#[shuttle_next::endpoint(method = post, route = "/hello")]
    async fn post_hello() -> &'static str {
        "Hello from post_hello!"
    }
}
```

Finally, to deploy your app, all you need to do is:
```bash
cargo shuttle project start
```

And then:
```bash
cargo shuttle deploy
```

And your app is live! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
