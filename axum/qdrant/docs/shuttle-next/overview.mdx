Shuttle-next is a brand new WASM web-framework based on axum and hyper. There are many benefits to
using WASM for a backend web-framework, but one of the key features is the isolation it offers. Since
WASM modules have no notion of a file system, a shuttle-next project can only interact with the host
through resources explicitly declared by us. In this first iteration, the only resource available is
an HTTP stream to and from a project.

Shuttle-next is very much a work in progress, and we're releasing this iteration without some of the 
features that make shuttle a pleasure to use, for example the ability to effortlessly deploy and connect 
to a database. It's also not currently possible to use any middleware. We're planning to implement this 
functionality, and more, in the near future. We're also hoping that the feedback we get from this release 
will help us see which features we should prioritize, and which areas of the framework's design need the 
most attention going forward.

<Info> Note: shuttle-next does not currently work on Windows, it only works on unix systems (i.e mac, Linux and Windows Subsystem for Linux). We aim to resolve this in future releases. </Info>
