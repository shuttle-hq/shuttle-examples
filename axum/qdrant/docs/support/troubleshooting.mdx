  <Accordion title="I get an error about protoc not being installed, or protoc being the wrong version.">
    Since Shuttle v0.18.0, `protoc` is no longer required to use Shuttle. If you encounter the above error,
    we recommend you upgrade to the latest version of `cargo-shuttle` and other Shuttle crates.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I've updated Shuttle and my project isn't working anymore.">
    If you've recently updated shuttle, in order to get your project back up, you need to run:
    `cargo shuttle project restart` and everything should be back in working order.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I'm struggling to install Shuttle on my M1/M2 Mac, what should I do?">
    There's a known bug with arm64 because of the openssl crates being built for x86, rather than arm64. In order to get around that issue, you can either run:

    `cargo install --features vendored-openssl cargo-shuttle`

    or install it via binary:

    `cargo binstall cargo-shuttle`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How can I return custom errors with Shuttle?">
    CustomError is an alias for `anyhow::Error`, the simplest way to output a relevant message here is by using `anyhow::Context` like this:

    ```rust
    pool.execute(include_str!("../schema.sql"))
        .await
        .context("failed to run migrations")?;
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How can I handle environment variables?">
    Add `shuttle-secrets` to the dependencies for your service, and add a `Secrets.toml` to the root of your project with the secrets you'd like to store. Make sure to add `Secrets*.toml` to your `.gitignore` to omit your secrets from version control.

    Next, pass `#[shuttle_secrets::Secrets] secret_store: SecretStore` as an argument to your `shuttle_runtime::main` function. `SecretStore::get` can now be called to retrieve your API keys and other secrets at runtime.

    For more details, and an explanation on how to use local secrets, head on over here: [Shuttle secrets](../resources/shuttle-secrets).
