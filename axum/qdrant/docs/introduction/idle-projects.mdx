title: "Idle Projects"
---

Shuttle imposes no restrictions on how many projects a user can 
create. While we are in alpha this is a win-win, users creating many and
varied projects is great for testing both our code and how we handle 
load. However, this leads to a sizable amount of idle projects. To 
remedy this, we put these idle projects to sleep, by default after **30 minutes** 
of very low activity.

By activity we mean both:

- CPU load of the project over a 30 minute window. The load is
increased when a project receives traffic (for example, traffic to an
API endpoint for an axum server, or calling the commands of a Discord bot).
An HTTP server (eg. axum or rocket), will need about 2 requests per minute over the idle-time period to be considered
active, a Discord bot will need about 6 calls per minute.
- User interaction, for example running `cargo shuttle status` or any other CLI commands except for `cargo shuttle project <cmd>` commands.

If the project is sleeping, traffic to the project or user 
interaction will wake it, and this usually takes around one
second. 

**Important: If a Discord bot is sleeping due to 
inactivity, calling the bot commands will not wake it, only developer 
interaction through the CLI will (but traffic will keep it from going to
 sleep). See the below instructions for how to increase the idle limit.**

### Configuring the timeout

Since we don't really want to restrict active users yet, this limit 
can be freely modified. You can change it by passing in a flag when 
creating a project:

```bash
cargo shuttle project start --idle-minutes 40
```

If you pass in `--idle-minutes 0`
the idle timeout will be disabled and your project will never sleep. 
This is especially useful for Discord bots, since they will not be 
awoken by traffic (people using the bot commands in a Discord channel), 
only by developer interaction through the Shuttle CLI.
