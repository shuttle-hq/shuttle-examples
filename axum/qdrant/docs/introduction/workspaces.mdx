description: "Using cargo workspaces with shuttle."

Shuttle supports [cargo workspace](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html). Simply run
the project and deployment commands in the root of the workspace, and the project name will be taken from the
directory name of the workspace or a `Shuttle.toml` with a name key in the root of the workspace. 

> Note: if you use `shuttle-static-folder` in your project and your project is a workspace, the static assets
> folder needs to be in the root of the workspace.

### Caveats

We currently only support one Shuttle service per workspace, so you can have many crates in a workspace, but only
one crate with a `shuttle_runtime::main` macro. We intend to allow starting several services in deployment too. 
The long term plan is to have one central service that routes to the other services in the project, sharing resources 
amongst them. Any feedback on what people would like to see in this area is most welcome.
