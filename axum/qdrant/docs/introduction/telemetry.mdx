## Tracing

When you build an app with the `#[shuttle_runtime::main]` macro, a global subscriber will be created and installed
[behind the scenes](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle/blob/001dbcfcf47066713598f00a98f4972de450ff3b/codegen/src/main/mod.rs#L237-L245).
This means that you can skip this step when implementing [tracing](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/) in your application, 
all you have to do is add `tracing` as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`, and you're good to go!

```rust
// [...]
use tracing::info;

#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn axum(#[shuttle_shared_db::Postgres] pool: PgPool) -> ShuttleAxum { 
    info!("Running database migration");
    pool.execute(include_str!("../schema.sql"))
        .await
        .map_err(CustomError::new)?;

    // [...]
}
```

## Log

If you'd rather use [log](https://docs.rs/log/latest/log/), everything from the above section on tracing applies.
A log-compatible layer is added to the global subscriber, so like with tracing, all you need to do to use `log` macros
in your project is add it to your `Cargo.toml`.

## Setting Log Level

The global subscriber has an `env_filter` which defaults to the `INFO` log level if no `RUST_LOG` variable is set. You can change the log level for local runs
with `RUST_LOG="<crate-name>=trace" cargo shuttle run`. We do not currently allow changing the log level for production deployments, and it will be set to `DEBUG` by default.

## Viewing Logs

We have a few commands that are useful for viewing your application's logs. 

To view the logs for your current deployment, in your project directory run:

```bash
cargo shuttle logs
```

You can also view logs of a specific deployment by adding the deployment id to this command:

```bash
cargo shuttle logs <id>
```

To get the deployment ID, you can run this command to view your deployment history:

```bash
cargo shuttle deployment list
```

And last but not least, if you'd like a live feed of your logs, run:

```bash
cargo shuttle logs --follow
```
