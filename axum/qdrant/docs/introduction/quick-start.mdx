We will assume that you have already installed Shuttle and logged in.
If you haven't, you should check out our [installation](./installation) section.

**Creating your first project**

To initialize your project, simply write:

```sh
cargo shuttle init
```
> Note: if you use [sparse registries](https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2023/01/30/cargo-sparse-protocol.html) (which
> is enabled by default on `nightly`), you may encounter [this bug](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle/issues/821) when 
> running the `init` command. To resolve this, see [this comment](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle/issues/821#issuecomment-1525317860).

If you didn't create the project environment in the init command, run:

```sh
cargo shuttle project start
```

And to deploy it:

```sh
cargo shuttle deploy
```

<Info> In case you haven't commited the changes to your repo, you'll have to add a `--allow-dirty` flag. </Info>

You can also run your project locally for development, check out our [local run](./local-run) section.

Feel free to build on top of the generated `hello-world` example or take a stab
at one of our [examples](../examples/axum).
