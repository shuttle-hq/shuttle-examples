title: "Shuttle Service Name"
---

## Overview

The name of a Shuttle service (your project), can be set up in three different ways.

## via the `--name` option

A new Shuttle service can be named by passing in a project name as an argument along with the `--name` option.  For example:

```bash
mkdir -p url-shortener
cargo shuttle init --template rocket --name url-shortener
```

This will create a new Rocket framework based project called `url-shortener` and will populate the name field within the `[package]` section name of the generated `Cargo.toml` file.

This method of naming overrides naming via `Shuttle.toml`, if that file is present at the root of the project folder.  It also overrides any name provided within `Cargo.toml`.

## via Shuttle.toml

If the `--name` option with a command is not used, the next method to name a project is via creating a `Shuttle.toml` file at the root level of the project folder.  In this file, place a key-value pair like so:

```toml 
name = <your-project-name>
```

Where `<your-project-name>` is whatever you wish to name the project.  This method of naming supercedes any name set in `Cargo.toml`.

## via Cargo.toml

In the absence of either of the previous two options, the project will be named based on the content of the `name = ` field of the `[package]` section within the `Cargo.toml` configuration file.

## Workspaces

If your project is a cargo workspace the name will be taken from a `Shuttle.toml` in the root of the workspace, or
from the directory name of the workspace. See [workspaces](../introduction/workspaces).
