  "Shuttle-next is a batteries-included, WASM-based backend web-framework."

Shuttle-next is a brand new WASM web-framework based on axum and hyper. There are many benefits to
using WASM for a backend web-framework, but one of the key features is the isolation it offers. Since
WASM modules have no notion of a file system, a shuttle-next project can only interact with the host
through resources explicitly declared by us. In this first iteration, the only resource available is
an HTTP stream to and from a project.

Shuttle-next is very much a work in progress, and we're releasing this iteration without some of the 
features that make shuttle a pleasure to use, for example the ability to effortlessly deploy and connect 
to a database. It's also not currently possible to use any middleware. We're planning to implement this 
functionality, and more, in the near future. We're also hoping that the feedback we get from this release 
will help us see which features we should prioritize, and which areas of the framework's design need the 
most attention going forward.

> Note: shuttle-next does not currently work on Windows, it only works on unix systems (i.e mac, Linux and 
> Windows Subsystem for Linux). We aim to resolve this in future releases.

## Hello world!

Simple 'Hello world' app using shuttle-next.

```bash
cargo new --lib hello-world
cd hello-world
```

Make sure that your `Cargo.toml` file looks like the one below -- having the right dependencies is key!
You'll also notice that this is a `cdylib` and not a binary, like other shuttle projects.

```toml Cargo.toml
[package]
name = "hello-world"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[lib]
crate-type = [ "cdylib" ]

[dependencies]
shuttle-next = "0.18.0"
```

Using the `shuttle-next::app!` macro, we can create HTTP API endpoints, setting the
method and the route endpoint in the `shuttle::endpoint()` macro arguments. Any function
that is a valid `axum` handler can be used, and you are free to add functions that aren't
annotated with the `shuttle_next::endpoint` macro and use them in your handlers. For now,
everything has to go in the same file, inside the `shuttle_next::app!` macro.

```Rust lib.rs
shuttle_next::app! {
    #[shuttle_next::endpoint(method = get, route = "/hello")]
    async fn hello() -> &'static str {
        "Hello, World!"
    }
}
```

To test your app locally you'll first need to add the `wasm32-wasi` target:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-wasi
```

And we're ready to start it up:

```bash
cargo shuttle run
```

Next, curl it to verify that it's working:

```bash
curl localhost:8000/hello
```

We can also add an endpoint that takes the body from the request using the axum `BodyStream`
extractor, lazily map its bytes to uppercase and stream it back in our response:

First, lets add the `futures` crate to our `Cargo.toml`:
```
cargo add futures
```

```rust lib.rs
shuttle_next::app! {
    // We need to add some imports (inside the app! macro), 
    // all re-exported from axum 0.6
    use shuttle_next::body::StreamBody;
    use shuttle_next::extract::BodyStream;
    use shuttle_next::response::{Response, IntoResponse};
    
    // We'll also need the futures `TryStreamExt` trait to manipulate 
    // the body stream
    use futures::TryStreamExt;

    #[shuttle_next::endpoint(method = post, route = "/uppercase")]
    async fn uppercase(body: BodyStream) -> impl IntoResponse {
        let chunk_stream = body.map_ok(|chunk| {
            chunk
                .iter()
                .map(|byte| byte.to_ascii_uppercase())
                .collect::<Vec<u8>>()
        });
        Response::new(StreamBody::new(chunk_stream))
    }
}
```

Let's run it again, and add a body to our request:
```bash
curl localhost:8000/uppercase -d "Please convert me to uppercase."
```

We can also add more handlers with the same route, granted they have different
HTTP methods:

```Rust lib.rs
shuttle_next::app! {
    #[shuttle_next::endpoint(method = get, route = "/hello")]
    async fn get_hello() -> &'static str {
        "Hello from get_hello!"
    }

	#[shuttle_next::endpoint(method = post, route = "/hello")]
    async fn post_hello() -> &'static str {
        "Hello from post_hello!"
    }
}
```

Finally, to deploy your app, all you need to do is:
```bash
cargo shuttle project start
```

And then:
```bash
cargo shuttle deploy
```

And your app is live! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
