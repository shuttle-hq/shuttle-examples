title: "Shuttle Static Folder"
---

This plugin allows services to get the path to a static folder at runtime, enabling the serving of static files such as web pages.

## Usage
Add `shuttle-static-folder` to the dependencies for your service. This resource can be utilized by adding a parameter to the main function and annoting it with the `shuttle_static_folder::StaticFolder` attribute, to get a `PathBuf` with the location of the static folder.

Here is a code snippet to illustrate::

``` rust
#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn main(
    #[shuttle_static_folder::StaticFolder] static_folder: PathBuf,
) -> __ { ... }
```

A `PathBuf` is an owned, mutable path (similar to a String). To know more about `PathBuf`, head over to the [discussion](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/path/struct.PathBuf.html) in [The Rust Standard Library](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html). By default, the folder is called `static`, unless specifically renamed (see below).

> Note: if you use `shuttle-static-folder` in your project and your project is a workspace, the static assets
> folder needs to be in the root of the workspace.

## Customization

The folder parameter name can be customized in order to change the name of the static folder.

| Parameter | Type | Default  | Description                                                        |
|-----------|------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| folder    | str  | `static` | The relative path, from the crate root, to the directory containing static files to deploy |

### Customization Example: Static Folder Renamed to Public Folder
The plugin defaults to a folder name of `static`, but there is freedom to change it.  When annotating the parameter name, as noted above, add an argument in the format `folder = "<desired name>"`, as follows:

``` rust
#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn main(
    #[shuttle_static_folder::StaticFolder(folder = "public")] public_folder: PathBuf,
) -> __ { ... }
```

The parameter name should be changed to match, in this case being `folder = "public"`.

## Example Usage
