title: "Shuttle Secrets"

This plugin manages secrets on [Shuttle](https://www.shuttle.rs).

## Usage
Add `shuttle-secrets` to the dependencies for your service, and add a `Secrets.toml` to the root of your project
with the secrets you'd like to store. Make sure to add `Secrets.toml` to a `.gitignore` to omit your secrets from version control.

The format of the Secrets.toml file is a key-value mapping with string values.

```toml
MY_API_KEY = 'the contents of my API key'
MY_OTHER_SECRET = 'some other secret'
```

Next, pass `#[shuttle_secrets::Secrets] secret_store: SecretStore` as an argument to your `shuttle_runtime::main` function.
`SecretStore::get` can now be called to retrieve your API keys and other secrets at runtime.

## Local secrets
When developing locally with `cargo shuttle run`, you can use a different set of secrets. If you add a `Secrets.dev.toml` to the
root of your project, these secrets will be used for local runs. The `Secrets.dev.toml` file will *only* be used for local runs.

If you don't have a `Secrets.dev.toml` file, `Secrets.toml` will be used locally as well as for deployments. If you want to have
both secret files with some of the same secrets for both local runs and deployments, you have to duplicate the secret across both 
files.


## Example
This snippet shows a Shuttle rocket main function that uses the `shuttle_secrets::Secrets` attribute to gain access to a `SecretStore`.

```rust main.rs
#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn rocket(
    #[shuttle_secrets::Secrets] secret_store: SecretStore,
) -> ShuttleRocket {
    // get secret defined in `Secrets.toml` file.
    let secret = if let Some(secret) = secret_store.get("MY_API_KEY") {
        secret
    } else {
        return Err(anyhow!("secret was not found").into());
    };

    let state = MyState { secret };
    let rocket = rocket::build().mount("/", routes![secret]).manage(state);

    Ok(rocket.into())
}
```
