title: "URL Shortener"
---

I was trying to get to sleep on a Wednesday night - I check my phone, it's 2:54
AM. A feeling of dread comes over me as I realise I'm not going to be able to
get more than 5 hours of sleep - again.

I've been a software developer for close to 10 years now. How did it get to
this?

My deployment broke production at 10pm (because I never learn) and I had to deal
with our infrastructure coupled with acute stress for the next 3 hours. As I sat
there contemplating my life choices, I had an idea. Can we do better?

I don't want to have to deal with Terraform and Kubernetes at midnight. I want
to write scalable code and just get it deployed. I want my dependencies
generated and managed for me. I want to be able to sleep at night.

It's 2022. **Surely** we can do better. As I stared blankly at my white ceiling,
I decided to see if it was possible.

I suddenly sat up in bed. Can I create a useful app, with some sort of database
state, a custom subdomain, focus only on my application code without needing to
worry about infrastructure and get it done in 10 minutes or less? I'll write a
URL shortener or something. I'll write in Rust. I'll write it tonight.

### Design

I got out of bed and turned on the lights in my office. I sat down on my
ergonomic chair and power up a comically large curved monitor. Arch boots up. I
quickly message a friend of mine on Signal to remind them that I use Arch. Now
I'm ready to code. Let's build this thing.

The API is going to be simple. No reason for GUIs or anything like that - I am
engineer, therefore I've convinced myself that UI's peaked with the 1970's
teletype.

Life's short so I'm going to build an HTTP API. The simplest thing I can come up
with.

You can shorten URLs like this:

```bash
curl -X POST -d 'https://www.google.com' https://myapp.com
https://myapp.com/uvAivJ
```

And you get redirected like this:

```bash
curl https://myapp.com/uvAivJ
< HTTP/2 301
...
```

Yeah that'll work.

Next I'll need some sort of database to store the urls. I briefly considered
using a bijective compression scheme without needing database state, but let's
face it I'm not really sure what a bijection is and it's already 3:02 AM.

I'll just get a Postgres instance with a basic schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE urls (
  id VARCHAR(6) PRIMARY KEY,
  url VARCHAR NOT NULL
);
```

Genius.

I'll add an index or something so that the database doesn't do a linear search
on every request. No one is really going to use this - but I can already feel
the judgement of anyone who happens to glance over my source code. I need to be
able to explain to people that you can search for urls in constant time,
implying I understand complexity theory.

Ok I'm ready. It's 3:05 AM. I have 10 minutes. I pick up my black vape and take
a large hit. Smoke fills up the room and I can't see the screen any more.
Whatever. I try to crack my fingers and neck for some dramatic flair, fail, and
open a terminal.

### Building the Barebones - 09:59 minutes remaining

I'm using [shuttle](https://www.shuttle.rs/) for this project. It's a serverless
platform built for Rust and I don't have to deal with provisioning databases, or
subdomains or any of that gunk. I already have the CLI
[installed](https://docs.shuttle.rs/introduction/installation).

I stop and think for a little bit - which web framework do I want to use? I think
I'm going to go with Rocket. It's pretty much production ready with a sweet API and
I'm reasonably proficient with it.

To initialize a rocket project with boilerplate, I can use the shuttle CLI `init` command:

```bash
cargo shuttle init --template rocket url-shortener
```

This leaves me with the following `main.rs` file:

```rust main.rs
#[macro_use]
extern crate rocket;

#[get("/")]
fn index() -> &'static str {
    "Hello, world!"
}

#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn rocket() -> shuttle_rocket::ShuttleRocket {
    let rocket = rocket::build().mount("/hello", routes![index]);

    Ok(rocket.into())
}
```

As you can see, this imports a few dependencies. Luckily, the `init` command takes care
of this as well, leaving us with the following `Cargo.toml`:

```toml Cargo.toml
[package]
name = "url-shortener"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
rocket = "0.5.0-rc.2"
shuttle-rocket = { version = "0.18.0" }
shuttle-runtime = { version = "0.18.0" }
tokio = { version = "1.26.0" }
```

The `init` command also created a new shuttle project for us. This starts an
isolated container in Shuttle's infrastructure.

Now, to deploy:

```sh
$ cargo shuttle deploy

```

Ok... this seemed a little too easy, let's see if it works.

```sh
$ curl -X https://url-shortener.shuttleapp.rs/hello
Hello, world!
```

Hm, not bad. I pour myself another shot...

### Adding Postgres - 07:03 minutes remaining

This is the part of my journey where I usually get a little flustered. I've set
up databases before, but it's always a pain. You need to provision a VM, make
sure storage isn't ephemeral, install and spin up the database, create an
account with the correct privileges and secure password, store the password in
some sort of secrets manager in CI, add your IP address and your VM's IP address
to the list of acceptable hosts etc etc etc. Oof that sounds like a lot of work.

Shuttle does a lot of this stuff for you - I just didn't remember how. I
quickly head over to the
[shuttle shared database](https://docs.shuttle.rs/resources/shuttle-shared-db)
section in the docs. I added the `sqlx` dependency to `Cargo.toml` and change
one line in `main.rs`:

```rust
#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn rocket(#[shuttle_shared_db::Postgres] pool: PgPool) -> ShuttleRocket {
    // [...]
}
```

By adding a parameter to the main `rocket` function, `shuttle` will
automatically provision a Postgres database for you, create an account and hand
you back an authenticated connection pool which is usable from your application
code.

Lets deploy it and see what happens:

```bash
cargo shuttle deploy
...
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 19.50s

        Project:            url-shortener
        Deployment Id:      538e41cf-44a9-4158-94f1-3760b42619a3
        Deployment Status:  DEPLOYED
        Host:               url-shortener.shuttleapp.rs
        Created At:         2022-04-13 03:08:30.412602556 UTC
        Database URI:       postgres://***:***@pg.shuttle.rs/db-url-shortener
```

I have a database! I couldn't help but chuckle a little bit. So far so good.

### Setting up the Schema - 06:30 minutes remaining

The database provisioned by `shuttle` is completely empty - I'm going to need to
either connect to Postgres and create the schema myself, or write some sort of
code to automatically perform the migration. As I start to ponder this seemingly
existential question I decide not to overthink it. I'm just going to go with
whatever is easiest.

I connect to the database provisioned by shuttle using
[pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) using the provided database URI and run the
following script:

```bash
CREATE TABLE urls (
  id VARCHAR(6) PRIMARY KEY,
  url VARCHAR NOT NULL
);
```

As I was ready to Google 'how to create index postgres' I realised that since
the `id` used for the url lookup is a primary key, which is implicitly a
'unique' constraint, Postgres would create the index for me. Cool.

### Writing the Endpoints - 05:17 remaining

The app's going to need two endpoints - one to `shorten` URLs and one to
retrieve URLs and `redirect` the user.

I quickly created two stubs for the endpoints while I thought about the actual
implementation:

```rust
#[get("/<id>")]
async fn redirect(id: String, pool: &State<PgPool>) -> Result<Redirect, Status> {
    unimplemented!()
}

#[post("/", data = "<url>")]
async fn shorten(url: String, pool: &State<PgPool>) -> Result<String, Status> {
    unimplemented!()
}
```

I decided to start with the shorten method. The simplest implementation I could think of is to generate a
unique id on the fly using the [nanoid](https://crates.io/crates/nanoid) crate
and then running an `INSERT` statement. Hm - what about duplicates? I decided
not to overthink it 🤷.

```rust
#[post("/", data = "<url>")]
async fn shorten(url: String, pool: &State<PgPool>) -> Result<String, Status> {
    let id = &nanoid::nanoid!(6);
    let p_url = Url::parse(&url).map_err(|_| Status::UnprocessableEntity)?;
    sqlx::query("INSERT INTO urls(id, url) VALUES ($1, $2)")
        .bind(id)
        .bind(p_url.as_str())
        .execute(&**pool)
        .await
        .map_err(|_| Status::InternalServerError)?;
    Ok(format!("https://url-shortener.shuttleapp.rs/{id}"))
}
```

Next I implemented the `redirect` method in a similar spirit. At this point I
started to panic as it was really getting close to the 10 minute mark. I'll do a
`SELECT *` and pull the first url that matches with the query id. If the id does
not exist, you get back a `404`:

```rust
#[get("/<id>")]
async fn redirect(id: String, pool: &State<PgPool>) -> Result<Redirect, Status> {
    let url: (String,) = sqlx::query_as("SELECT url FROM urls WHERE id = $1")
        .bind(id)
        .fetch_one(&**pool)
        .await
        .map_err(|e| match e {
            Error::RowNotFound => Status::NotFound,
            _ => Status::InternalServerError
        })?;
    Ok(Redirect::to(url.0))
}
```

Whoops there's a typo in the SQL query.

After I fixed my typo and sorted out the various unresolved dependencies by
letting my IDE do the heavy lifting for me, I deployed to shuttle for the last
time.

### Moment of truth - 00:25 minutes remaining

Feeling like an off-brand Tom Cruise in mission impossible I stared intently at
the clock counting down as shuttle deployed my url-shortener. 19.3 seconds and
we're live. As soon as the `DEPLOYED` dialog came up, I instantly tested it out:

```bash
$ curl -X POST -d "https://google.com" https://url-shortener.shuttleapp.rs
https://s.shuttleapp.rs/XDlrTB⏎
```

I then copy/pasted the shortened URL to my browser and, lo an behold, was
redirected to Google.

I did it.

### Retrospective - 00:00 minutes remaining

With a sigh of relief I pushed myself back from my desk. I refilled my mug,
picked it up and headed to my derelict balcony. As I slid open the the windows
and the cold air flowed into my apartment, I took two steps forward to rest my
elbows and mug on the railing.

I sat there for a while reflecting on what had just happened. I _had_ succeeded.
I'd successfully built a somewhat trivial app quickly without needing to worry
about provisioning databases or networking or any of that jazz.

But how would this measure up in the real world? Real software engineering is
complex, involving collaboration across different teams with different
skill-sets. The entire world of software is barely keeping it together. Is it
really feasible to replace our existing, tried and tested cloud paradigms with a
new paradigm of not having to deal with infrastructure at all? What I knew for
sure is I wasn't going to get to the bottom of this one tonight.

As I went back to my bedroom and laid once more in bed, I noticed I was
grinning. There's a chance we really can do better. Maybe we're not exactly
there yet, but my experience tonight had given me a certain optimism that we
aren't as far as I once thought. With the promise of a brighter tomorrow, I
turned on my side and fell asleep.
