# Axum + htmx

This is an example of how you can use Shuttle with Axum, Askama and htmx to create a frontend that's easily extendable and requires zero framework knowledge, while being able to easily inject variables from the backend into the frontend.

The app is a TODO list with a main page and an event stream page.

## Usage

Run the app and go to <http://localhost:8000> to add and remove TODOs from the list.
