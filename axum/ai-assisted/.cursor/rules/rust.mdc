- Use explicit error handling with `Result<T, E>` and avoid unwrap() in production code.
- Prefer borrowing (&T) over owned values (T) in function parameters when possible.
- Use pattern matching exhaustively and handle all enum variants explicitly.
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility.
- Use `derive` macros for common traits like Debug, Clone, PartialEq when appropriate.
- Leverage the type system to prevent invalid states at compile time.
