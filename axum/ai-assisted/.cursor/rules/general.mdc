- Always use the `search_docs` MCP tool to search through the Shuttle documentation.
- Keep code simple, readable, and follow established patterns in the codebase.
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable and function names.
- Handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.
- Prefer composition over inheritance and favor immutability when possible.
- Write tests for critical functionality and edge cases.
- Avoid premature optimization - write clear code first, optimize later if needed.
