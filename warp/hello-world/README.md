# Warp Hello World

## Introduction

An example that showcases using the `warp` web service framework with Shuttle.

## Features

- A route that returns `Hello, world!`.

## Pre-requisites

- Rust
- [cargo-shuttle](https://www.shuttle.dev)

## How to use this template

Run the project with `shuttle run`.

Visit <http://localhost:8000> to try it out.

When you're ready to deploy, use `shuttle deploy`.

## Troubleshooting

- Shuttle connects by default to port 8000 - if you're currently already using something at port 8000, you can add
  the `--port <port-number>` to the `shuttle run` command to change this.
