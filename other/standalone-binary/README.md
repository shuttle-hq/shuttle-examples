# Standalone binary - run an app with Shuttle or standalone

This example shows how to separate a project's Shuttle logic from its core functionality so that two binaries can be made: one for running with `cargo shuttle run` and deploying to Shuttle, and one that can be run with `cargo run --bin ...`.

All startup logic is placed in the binary source files, while the implementation (endpoints etc) is moved to the library of the crate.

- `src/bin/shuttle.rs` is the main binary with Shuttle, run with `cargo shuttle run`. Note that the `[[bin]]` entry in `Cargo.toml` needs to have the same name as the crate. The file can have any name you want.
- `src/bin/standalone.rs` is without Shuttle, run with `cargo run --bin standalone` (you can change the name)

This example shows how to use separate logic for getting secrets (`shuttle-secrets` vs homemade solution), but the same approach can be applied to other resources that are initiated by Shuttle's main function.
