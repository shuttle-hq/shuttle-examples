# Url Shortener

A URL shortener that you can use from your terminal - built with shuttle, rocket and postgres/sqlx.

## How to use it

You can use this URL shortener directly from your terminal. Just copy and paste this command to your terminal and replace `<URL>` with the URL that you want to shorten

```bash
curl -X POST -d '<URL>' https://s.shuttleapp.rs
```

like this

```bash
curl -X POST -d 'https://docs.rs/shuttle-service/latest/shuttle_service/' https://s.shuttleapp.rs
```

you will get the shortened URL back (something like this `https://s.shuttleapp.rs/RvpVU_`)

## Project structure

The project consists of the following files

- `Shuttle.toml` contains the name of the app (if name is `s` domain will be `s.shuttleapp.rs`)
- `migrations` folder is for DB migration files created by [sqlx-cli](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/tree/master/sqlx-cli)
- `src/lib.rs` is where all the magic happens - it creates a shuttle service with two endpoints: one for creating new short URLs and one for handling shortened URLs.

## How to deploy

To deploy this app, check out the repository locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle.git
```

navigate to `examples/rocket/url-shortener`

```bash
cd examples/rocket/url-shortener
```

install shuttle

```bash
cargo install cargo-shuttle
```

login to shuttle

```bash
cargo shuttle login
```

Pick a project name that is something unique - in shuttle,
projects are globally unique. Then run

```bash
cargo shuttle project start --name=$PROJECT_NAME
cargo shuttle deploy --name=$PROJECT_NAME
```
