# Welcome to Loco :train:

This is a version of Loco's SaaS starter which includes a `User` model and authentication based on JWT, as well as subscription payments via Stripe.

## Pre-requisites
You will need a Stripe API key. Stripe is free to sign up for and try out in Test Mode.

## Quick Start

Clone this example using `cargo shuttle init --from shuttle-hq/shuttle-examples --subfolder loco/saas`, then use `cargo shuttle run`.

You will need a Stripe API key to be able to fully use this template.

## Deployment

Use `cargo shuttle deploy --allow-dirty` and watch the magic happen!

As with the quick-start section, you will need a Stripe API to fully use thie template.
